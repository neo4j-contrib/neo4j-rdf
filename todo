TODO

 o In RDF the literal/datatype pair is unique (would equal different nodes
 	in the node space).
	I.e. "literal" != "literal"^^xsd:string
	I.e. "literal"^^float != "literal"^^double
	I.e. "literal"@en != "literal"
 o In RDF you can't have datatype AND language on the same literal.
 o We now pass everything down as strings, we should implement the conversion
   code in Literal correctly
 o We need reasoning via meta model
